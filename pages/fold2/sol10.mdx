# Leap Years in a Range

This program finds and lists all leap years within a user-defined range. Leap years are those which are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400. The user is prompted to input a starting and ending year, and the program will display all leap years between these two values.

### Code Breakdown

## Algorithm

1. **Start**
2. **Input** the starting year and ending year.
3. **For** each year in the range from the starting year to the ending year:
   - **Check** if the year is a leap year:
     - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 **and** not divisible by 100 **or** it is divisible by 400.
   - **If** the year is a leap year, **print** the year.
4. **End**
